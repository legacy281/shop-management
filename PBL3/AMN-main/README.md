Before running the program, you need to create database on xampp,db include:  
-score  
-user (it's for account admin)  
-student  
-teacher  
-course  
_It has quite a few fields, but I'm too lazy to list them :((_  
Actually, you should create your own database to better understand the project. I'm sure  
And of course we use the 3-layer model include GUI, BUS and DBConnect  
To design a beautiful form, we used service GUNA.GUI2
We think it's nicer and easier on the eyes than the default form in C#, but if you use a laptop with a different screen than ours then in the form design you'll find it pretty ugly.  
But rest assured, that doesn't matter, the important thing is that when you run the program, it will look as good as on my laptop, I'm sure  
_Good luck_
